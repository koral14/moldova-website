                    <p>This small landlocked European country is found between Romania to the west and the Ukraine to the east. 
                        Up until World War II, it was a part of Romania and if you visit both countries, you'll see a lot of cultural similarities. 
                        Then it was part of the Soviet Union until 1991, so you'll also see a number of similarities there.<br><br> But Moldova has a lot to offer in its own right.  
                        First, it's remote and rarely visited - making it perfect for adventurers who want to blaze a trail. 
                        Second, it has a growing wine-tourism industry and those who know wines know that some of the best in Europe come from Moldova. 
                        You'll find traditions are still alive and hospitality in the villages is genuine.<br><br>Consider these top attractions while you are planning your trip.</p>

                            <p>This is a modern and friendly place - Moldova's biggest city that serves as its capital. 
                            Chisinau has loads of green space, parks, and historical buildings.<br><br>
                            There's also no shortage of restaurants, art galleries, nightclubs, spas, and casinos!<br><br>
                            You'll want to visit Pushkin Park and the orange pyramid at the World War II memorial. 
                            You'll find marvellous frescoes in the Nativity Cathedral, and if that's not for you, 
                            check out the stalls of the local modern artists in the art market.</p><br><br><br>

                                <p>Thirty minutes away from Chisinau is Cricova Winery. 
                                    The second largest underground winery in the world; it is definitely something to experience.<br><br> 
                                    You'll find 120 kilometres of complex roadways above ground and an elaborate tunnel system underground which 
                                    has been in place since the 15th century when the limestone was dug out to build Chisinau. 
                                    This wonderful “wine city” includes warehouses, underground tasting rooms, and guided tours. 
                                    You'll travel 100 metres below ground and have a look at what 1.25 million bottles of wine looks like.<br><br>
                                    The wine industry is growing in Moldova, which means that it's worth bringing a bottle or two home.</p>

                            <p>Just an hour outside of Chisinau is Orheiul, or Old Orhei, Moldova''s most incredible sight. 
                                It's an archaeological complex with rich cultural and historical significance. It's also a place of stunning natural beauty. 
                                Overlooking the Raut River, this open-air complex features fortifications, baths, caves, ruins, 
                                and monasteries - all which date back as late as the Dacian tribes of 2000 years ago.<br><br>
                                The ancient monuments date from various periods including the Tatar and Mongol invasions, the 10th century BC, 
                                and more recently the occupation of the Golden Horde in the 14th century. Because of the unusualness of the area, 
                                a museum has been built that offer exhibits and provide information and context for such a unique place.</p><br></div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Soroca has played a large and important role throughout Moldova's history due to its location on the Dniestr River. 
                        During wars and sieges, armies were able to defend the country well from this vantage point. <br><br>
                        The highlight is Soroca Fortress, one in a chain of military strongholds built as early as the 14th century 
                        by princes looking to fortify their position against invaders.  Because of the large Roma community here, Soroca is the unofficial Roma capital.<br><br>
                        For fun, walk by the mansions of the Roma elite that line the streets of the city centre.</p><br><br><br><br>

                    </div>
                    <p>Located in a remote part of Moldova, Tipova Monastery comprises three main complexes that have been dug out 
                        of the rocks along the banks of the Dniestr River. The oldest complex is the Church of the Feast of the Holy Cross (11th century).<br><br>
                        The remaining two are the Church of St Nicholas (14th century) and Horodiste (16th century).<br><br>
                        If you follow the path past the caves you'll enjoy a nice nature hike that ends in a lovely waterfall. Within each cave are monk's cells, 
                        enough for up to 700, though there are less than 20 monks living there now.</p>

                    <p>Being situated in a lush green forest, Capriana is one of the oldest monasteries in Moldova.  
                        Founded in the 15th century by Alexander the Good, it was once the home of the Moldavian bishop as well as Chiprian, 
                        one of the first Moldavian poets.  It houses the largest convent library in the country and after years of neglect, 
                        was reopened in 1989 as a symbol of national revival.<br><br>While you're there, 
                        you can make some stops nearby to visit the oak tree of Stefan the Great and Codru, the oldest nature reserve in the country.</p>
