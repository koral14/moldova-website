        <p><b>If you decide to visit Moldova then you might find our list of simple and useful tips quite handy, especially if it's your first time.</b><br><br>

            1. If you happened to arrive by airplane - be careful choosing a taxi at the airport. <br><br>
            2. Do not go off exchanging all your foreign currency at the exchange parlors at the airport or at the train station, they will quote you the most unfavorable rates in town. If you happen to have a Visa card, then you don't need exchanges at all - you can easily withdraw any amount of cash from an ATM. The exchange rate quoted by ATMs corresponds to the rate of the bank that owns it. You will receive your money in Moldovan national currency and will have to pay a small commission.</p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Moldova</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p> 3. If you are travelling across Moldova for the first time then you should consider getting yourself a guide who knows his way around. You can find a guide at any travel agency.<br><br>
                4. Shopping is something you will definitely enjoy if you go to the right places. Paying by credit or debit card will be acceptable if you go to a supermarket or some boutique. If, on the other hand you wish to buy a painting, or a hand-made souvenir at the Chisinau Arbat you will need to pay in cash. All markets work from 8:00AM till 10:00PM. A number of stores are open 24/7.<br><br>
                5. If you happen to have an emergency situation you can call the emergency services - in case of a fire call 901, in case criminal activity call 902, and in case of a medical emergency call 903.<br><br>
                6. Excursions, entertainment, health centers are available through tourist agencies as well as in a private manner. If you arrived in Moldova, don't limit yourself to Chisinau - instead try to visit as much of the countries sites and attractions as possible in all the picturesque corners of the country. As far as food is concerned, we recommend to visit the restaurants that make national Moldovan cuisine. The restaurants of Chisinau offer excellent services, delicious meals, and affordable prices.<br><br>
                7. People in Moldova talk in Russian and Romanian, so if do not posses any skills in one of these languages getting a guide would be a good idea, or at least a pocket dictionary. The service personnel at hotels and restaurants oftentimes can speak English, German, or French.</p><br><br>
